! profile_columns.list -- determines the contents of star model profiles
! you can use a non-standard version by setting profile_columns_file in your inlist

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! if you have a situation where you want a non-standard set of columns,
! make a copy of this file, edit as desired, and give the new filename in your inlist
! as profile_columns_file.   if you are just adding columns, you can 'include' this file,
! and just list the additions in your file.   note: to include the standard default
! version, use include '' -- the 0 length string means include the default file.

! the following lines of the profile contain info for 1 zone per row, surface to center.

! first we'll include the standard set of lines
include ''

! q = m(r)/M
logxq ! log10(1-q)

! now we'll include some variables that control convection
! first, the adiabatic gradient, and its difference with the radiative temperature gradient
grada ! dlnT_dlnP at constant S
grada_sub_gradT

! the Brunt frequency, scaled to a dimensionless number
brunt_N2_dimensionless ! N2 in units of 3GM/R^3

! convection velocity divided by sound speed
conv_vel_div_csound
